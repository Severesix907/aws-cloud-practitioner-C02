#### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. On-demand delivery indicates that AWS has the resources you need, when you need them. 

#### What are the three deployment models for cloud computing, their definitions, and uses?
- Cloud-based Deployment Model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud. You can build those applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them.
  - Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
  - Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
  - Design and build new applications in the cloud.
- On-premises deployment is also known as a private cloud deployment.  In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.
  - Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
  - Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.
- Hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. You might want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises.
  - Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
  - Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

AWS Outposts extend AWS infrastructure to on-premises locations, allowing for consistent hybrid operations, low-latency access to on-premises systems, and local data processing to meet specific regulatory or performance requirements.

How are AWS Lambda and AWS Outposts different in what they offer for cloud computing?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers, while AWS Outposts provide AWS services and infrastructure on-premises for low-latency applications and hybrid cloud deployments.

What is high availability?
High availability refers to systems or components that are continuously operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, often achieved through redundancy and failover mechanisms.

What are the benefits of AWS having a global infrastructure with multiple regions?
AWS's global infrastructure with multiple regions ensures high availability, disaster recovery, low latency, data sovereignty compliance, and fault tolerance for applications and services.

What is an AWS Region?
An AWS Region is a geographic area consisting of multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones, used to deploy and manage AWS resources.

Why is data sovereignty important in AWS Regions?
Data sovereignty ensures that data is subject to the privacy laws and regulations of the country or region where it is stored, which is crucial for compliance and legal requirements.

How do AWS Regions enhance disaster recovery capabilities?
AWS Regions enhance disaster recovery by allowing data and applications to be replicated across geographically separated locations, ensuring business continuity in case of regional failures.
